cxNES is an open source, cross-platform NES/Famicom emulator.  It is
mainly written as a part-time hobby project to suit the needs of its
author, but with accuracy, performance and portability as primary
goals.

cxNES is written in C and uses SDL 2.0 for graphics, sound and input,
and GTK+ for the GUI toolkit.  It should have the same functionality
and roughly the same look and feel on all supported platforms.
Currently only Windows and Linux are supported; OS X support will be
coming as soon as the author can get a Mac for development and
testing.  Other unix variants may work as well provided they have
working SDL 2.0 and GTK+ libraries, but none have been tested.

--------
* Supports IPS, UPS and BPS patch formats

Video
-----
* Bisquit's NTSC palette generator
* Blargg's nes_ntsc filter
* User can specify a 64 or 512 color external palette
  file to be used instead of the generated palette.

  the limit appears to be exploited intentionally, otherwise does not

* PNG screenshots

Input
-----
* Flexible input binding support
  + Nearly all emulator actions can have custom keyboard and/or
    joystick mappings
  + User-defined 'modifiers' useful for button combos on gamepads
    with few buttons (such as standard NES controllers)
* SDL GameController API
  + Allows supported joysticks (including XInput devices) to have
    a common set of sane default mappings.
  + Additional gamepads may be added by editing a plain-text
    mapping database
  + SDL Joystick API also supported for devices not recognized by
    the GameController API.
* Turbo support for controllers
  + Supports dedicated turbo buttons
  + Supports toggle buttons to enable/disable turbo on the standard
    A and B buttons.

Misc
----
* Savestates
  + Can auto-load/save states on ROM load/unload
  + Can auto-save state at a user-specified interval
* Dynamic audio resampling
  + Uses Blargg's blip_buf resampler
* Cheat support (Game Genie, Pro Action Rocky, and raw formats)
