cxNES Documentation

Version 0.2.0
Updated 2015-10-22

Intro
=====
cxNES is an open source, cross-platform NES/Famicom emulator.  It is
mainly written as a part-time hobby project to suit the needs of its
author, but with accuracy, performance and portability as primary
goals.

cxNES is written in C and uses SDL 2.0 for graphics, sound and input,
and GTK+ for the GUI toolkit.  It should have the same functionality
and roughly the same look and feel on all supported platforms.
Currently only Windows and Linux are supported; OS X support will be
coming as soon as the author can get a Mac for development and
testing.  Other unix variants may work as well provided they have
working SDL 2.0 and GTK+ libraries, but none have been tested.

You can contact the author at [perilsensitive@gmail.com](mailto:perilsensitive@gmail.com).

Patching
--------
* Supports IPS, UPS and BPS patch formats
* Autopatching support
* Soft-patching
* Patches may be applied via GUI or specified on

-----
* Bisquit's NTSC palette generator
* Blargg's nes_ntsc filter
* User can specify a 64 or 512 color external palette
  file to be used instead of the generated palette.

    with few buttons (such as standard NES controllers)
* SDL GameController API
  + Allows supported joysticks (including XInput devices) to have
    a common set of sane default mappings.
  + Additional gamepads may be added by editing a plain-text
    mapping database
  + SDL Joystick API also supported for devices not recognized by
    the GameController API.
* Turbo support for controllers
  + Supports dedicated turbo buttons
  + Supports toggle buttons to enable/disable turbo on the standard
    A and B buttons.

Portable Mode (Windows only)
----------------------------
The Windows build of cxNES stores all user data (save files, state files, cheats,
etc.) in %APPDATA%\cxnes by default.  To run cxNES as a portable app so
that user data is stored in the same folder as cxNES itself, you can enable portable
mode.  This can be done by passing '--portable' on the cxNES command line, but this
will only enable portable mode until you exit cxNES.  To make cxNES always use portable
mode, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named 'data' in the same folder where you extracted
   cxNES, then create a folder named 'cxnes' inside the new 'data'
   folder.  These folders are included in the cxNES zipfile, so they
   should already exist (assuming you didn't delete them).

2. Create a file in data\cxnes called 'portable.txt'.  You can create
   this file any way you'd like; it's probably easiest to just use
   Notepad.  The contents of this file don't matter; cxNES doesn't
   read the file, but only checks to see if it exists.  If this file
   exists, cxNES wil run in portable mode.  If not, and you didn't pass
   '--portable' on the command line, it will run normally.

3. If you have user data in %APPDATA%\cxnes already, you may want to
   copy it to data\cxnes inside the folder where cxNES is installed.

cxNES should now always look for user data in the data\cxnes folder
inside the folder where cxNES is located rather than in
%APPDATA%\cxnes.

To upgrade a portable installation, you can unzip the new version of
cxNES into the same folder as the old one.  User data (stuff in the
data folder) will not be touched, so you don't need to worry about
wiping out your save states or save files.  Alternatively, you can
just extract the new version of cxNES to a new folder and copy or move
the data folder from the old version to the new one.

All other Famicom Keyboard keys are mapped to the key with the same
symbol on the keycap (e.g., 'U' is mapped to 'U').

Famicom Disk System
===================
Famicom Disk System support requires a copy of the Famicom Disk System BIOS. 
You can configure cxNES with the location of this file via the GUI
(Options -> Path Configuration -> FDS BIOS Path) or the config file (set fds_bios_path).
You can also put it in the directories listed below (which you use will depend on your
platform), but you must name the file 'disksys.rom' if you want cxNES to use it automatically.

Linux:  
* $HOME/.local/share/cxnes
* The global data directory for cxnes (/usr/local/share/cxnes by default, or
  /usr/share/cxnes if you installed from a package)

Windows:  
* %APPDATA%\cxnes
* The same folder as cxnes.exe

Thanks to the nesdev community for their fantastic work at reverse-
engineering and documenting the NES.  Without the excellent information
found on the wiki, the various documents hosted on the nesdev.com website,
and the forum discussions, I would have been completely lost.
