NSF Support
-----------
cxNES has support for NES Sound Format (NSF) files.  Currently, the following
expansion audio chips are supported:

- VRC6
- VRC7
- FDS
- MMC5
- Namco 163
- Sunsoft 5B

The player ROM is based on Loopy's PowerPak NSF player.  On screen,
you will see the title of the NSF, the artist/composer, and copyright
information, plus the current and total number of songs.

The player is controlled using Controller 1 as follows:

Up: increase playback speed
Down: decrease playback speed
Left/B: previous track
Right/A: next track
Select: stop playback
Start: start playback

The NSF header specifies the starting track, but you can override that
by passing '-t <n>' on the command line, where '<n>' is the track
number you want to play first.

The NSF player rom is stored in /usr/local/share/cxnes/nsf.rom by default,
but if you have a modified version you may specify the location by setting
the nsf_rom configuration option to the absoute path of your ROM.

The source code for Loopy's NSF player (both with and without my
modifications) is included in the source tarball and may be freely
used, modified and distributed without any restrictions.
